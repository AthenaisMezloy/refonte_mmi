                    <p>
                    The students who want to incorporate the Gustave Eiffel University during one or two semesters have to contact the coordinator of their University beforehand. The Gustave Eiffel University accepts only selected students in accordance with the agreement between the two Universities.<br>
                    After the student is designated, he/she will collect an email with the link toward the registration form that the student will have to complete and submit online before the deadline.
                    </p> <br>
                    <h4>Visa and residence permit</h4>
                    <p>
                    The students who come from a country out of Europe will have to get a visa, and need a letter of acceptance from our service.
                    If the sojourn is less than 3 months, the residence permit is not necessary, but if it’s taller than this duration, the residence permit is required.
